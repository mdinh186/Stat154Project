# Stat154Project
Adult Income Prediction project 

1. Introduction, which may include:
- Summary of the project and data, as well as any relevant context, background, or framing issues.
- The "big question" (i.e what is the prediction task behind this project)
- Brief outline of remainder of report.

The body of the report can be organized in several ways.

 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 

There is no need to include all the things you explored, processed, transformed, wrangled, etc. While the EDA stage will likely occupy a considerable proportion of your code, your EDA written section of the report should be kept simple (no need to include code). Instead, write about the general steps you followed and decisions you made with respect to any of the following aspects:

Handling missing values
Handling outliers
Changing scales
Binning (i.e. discretizing)
Converting to (dummy) indicators
Summary statistics
Visualizing distributions
Association between each predictor and the response
Feel free to include output/ and images/ folders in your file structure to store results from the EDA stage (and avoiding polluting the report).

 

Analysis and Methods (model building)

For each of the performed methods, you can include a brief description of what each method does (e.g. basic working principles, key ideas, goal), the functions and packages used to carry out the model building process, the main results (tables, summaries, graphs) and their corresponding descriptions and interpretations.

 

Conclusion(s)/Discussion

The conclusion should reprise the prediction task of the introduction,
perhaps augmented by some additional observations or details gleaned from the analysis/methods section. New questions, future work, etc., can also be raised here.
